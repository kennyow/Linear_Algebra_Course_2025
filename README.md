## 🚀 About this Repository

This repository accompanies the course **“Linear Algebra – Applied Concepts for Computational Sciences”**, designed to teach both the **theory** and the **practical implementation** of linear algebra in modern computational contexts.

Unlike traditional textbook approaches, this course emphasizes **applied linear algebra**, with hands-on programming examples in **Python** and **MATLAB**. Whether you are a student, engineer, data scientist, or machine learning enthusiast, this repository will help bridge the gap between math and code.
